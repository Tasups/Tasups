Hi All!

My name is Jason. I'm a fullstack engineer working with JavaScript language and libraries such as React, Node, Express, etc. I have familiarity with many types of technologies including HTML5, CSS3, ES6-ES8, D3, MySQL, MongoDB, Netlify, Bootstrap, Wordpress, MaterialUI, Github, JQuery, building APIs, etc.

I'm self taught and pride myself on having the ability to learn new things quickly.
